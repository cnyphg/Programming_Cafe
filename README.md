# Programming Café  ☕️

## ⚙️ Introduction
The Asia Pacific University (APU) has implemented an innovative program called "Programming Café" which provide the university students with extra sessions for code-learning. This program aims to provide students with valuable coding experiences and foster a supportive learning environment. Students will gain opportunities to learn programming languages such as C, Java, C++, Python and more. 

The purpose of conducting this program is to enhance students' logical and critical thinking, problem-solving skills, coding proficiency, and self-confidence. This experimental initiative offers additional coding sessions out of the usual timetable to avoid clashing. Each of the session will last for 2 hours, and dedicated classrooms will been assigned for those sessions. 

The sessions is going to be conducted by knowledgeable APU graduates who are expertising in various coding languages. To incentivize their participation, they will be remunerated with a flat rate of RM100 for every 2-hour session conducted. 


## 📂 Assumptions

### Valid User Input
> It is assumed that users will provide valid input when interacting with the program. This assumption helps simplify the design by not extensively handling error cases for invalid or unexpected input.
### Single User Execution
> It is assumed that the program will be executed by a single user at a time. This simplifies the design by not incorporating complex multi-user functionalities or data synchronization mechanisms.
### Reliable File System
> It is assumed that the file system used by the program will be reliable and capable of storing and retrieving data without significant errors or data corruption.
### Secure User Authentication
> A user authentication system is in place to ensure secure user authentication, and each user will have a unique login credential to access the system. The three types of users are Admin, Tutor, and Student. The system will provide relevant features and functionalities based on the user type upon successful login.
### Admin Authorization
> The admin user has the authority to manage various aspects of the system, including registering new tutors, adding new programming café sessions, registering students, and enrolling students in sessions.
